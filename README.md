 I made the Gloria Jeans Coffee Clone In this project, I prepared a javascript json compatible data set containing coffee products on mock data. In the project, there is first a homepage, then I prepared an about us page for better recognition of the brand and a contact page for users to communicate, then there is a Franchising page for brand marketing application. Afterwards, we are greeted by a page containing Coffee products. On this page, there are In-Page Search, Product Filtering Operations,View products with high ratings , Adding the Product to the Cart, Adding to Favorites, Viewing the Cart.
